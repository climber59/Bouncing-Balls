# Balls

## fullScreenBall
The ball will bounce around your monitor's screen, but will only be visible if it passes through one of the 4 figures.

## rectBall
The ball bounces around the figure. Click and drag to add a rectangle for it to bounce off. Shift-Click and drag to add a circle. Right click to delete obstacles. Backspace to delete all obstacles. Space to pause.

## multiWindowBall
My favorite. The ball will bounce around the figure windows and will move into a new figure where they overlap. Instructions printed to the Command Window on execution.
